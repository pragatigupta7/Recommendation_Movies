# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
#### Overview
This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It analyzes movie attributes such as genres, plot summaries, and keywords to find similar movies. The recommendation engine uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and similarity measures to provide personalized suggestions.

### Features
- Movie Similarity Calculation: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find similar movies.
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on metadata (genre, cast, keywords, etc.).
- User-Friendly Interface: This can be integrated with a web or GUI-based application.
- Scalable Dataset Handling: Works with large movie datasets efficiently.
